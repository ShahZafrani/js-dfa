### Original Assignment Instructions

> Write a program that can simulate a DFA accept the language {0*1*}.
>
>Basically, if I input any string to your program, the DFA will show the process of accepting 
>
>You may form a group with 3 or 4 persons. If your group has less than 3 person, you need to contact me.
>
>Each group needs to do a 10 min presentation around 2 weeks later. Each student in the group will be graded equally unless it was reported to me and confirmed that some student did not do sufficient work for the project.
